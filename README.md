# Smart-Parking-And-Guidance-System
This project presents a Smart Parking System leveraging IoT technology and cloud computing to address urban parking challenges. The system integrates ESP8266 Wi-Fi modules with the Firebase real-time database for efficient parking space management. It monitors and displays the availability of parking spaces across multiple buildings, providing real-time updates on an LCD. By reducing traffic congestion and vehicle emissions, the system enhances urban efficiency, contributing to improved environmental sustainability. Additionally, it creates employment opportunities and improves overall welfare by facilitating smoother urban mobility and enhancing the quality of life. This smart solution supports Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to sustainable cities, climate action, and economic growth.
